			1 is enabled on usart 3 TX
			0 is disabled
		Added VTXON mode
			If telem_smartaudio = 1 and VTXON is set to a channel, a power on comand will be sent to the smart audio TX on USART 3 TX pin when the mode is actiaved
				This will only happen when the board is disarmed
			If telem_smartaudio = 1 and VTXON is not set to a channel, a power on comand will be sent to the smart audio TX on USART 3 TX pin during arming
			NOTE! This is the recomended way to run smart audio - not using the VTXON mode will delay arming by half a second to allow the smart audio time to turn on
		Added "sainit" command
			If telem_smartaudio = 1 the VTX connected to usart 3's TX pin will be queried for current settings and reported back to the console
		Added "sapit" command
			If telem_smartaudio = 1 and sainit has been run, the VTX connected to usart 3's TX pin will be placed into semi-permanant pit mode
				this means the vtx will always power up into pit mode once this command is run
				the vtx can be returned to normal opperation by holding the VTX's button down during power up (hence it's only semi-permanant) :)
		Added "saon" command
			If telem_smartaudio = 1 and sainit has been run, the VTX connected to usart 3's TX pin will be sent the power up command (leave pit mode)

	Recomended Smart Audio Setup:
		1. Connect SmartAudio cable to USART3 TX pin (USART3 RX is still okay for Smart Port, you can use USART1 for Spektrum RXs)
		2. Power up SmartAudio VTX and flight controller, connect to configurator
		3. In console run the command "set telem_smartaudio=1"
		4. In console run the command "sainit"
		5. In console run the command "saunlock"
		6. In console run the command "sapit"
		7. On setup page in configurator, set VTXON mode to a channel (I use channel 8 on a momentary switch)
		8. Click Save
		9. Unpower FC and VTX
		10. You can use your spektrum radio to set your VTX channel and band, or you can use console "sach x" where x is a channel number from 0 through 39 
		11. enabling the VTXON mode will turn on the VTX, the VTX will not transmit until the flight mode is enabled at least momentarily
