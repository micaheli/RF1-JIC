Version 0.090.030:

	Made a copy of my Taranis model that will work with a new command called taranisdefaultsrf1 if anyone's interested.
	Added spekdefaults1 and spekdefaults3 based on whichever usart you use.
	spekdefaults 3 will not work with dshot
	I changed the version as well. Next version is 0.090.030.  MAJOR.MINOR.CONFIG
	If config gets incremented you'll know you have to run setup again. The plan is to change that in the future.
